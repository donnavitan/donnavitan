### Hey, my name is Donna Vitan!


I'm a user experience, interaction, and visual designer committed to inclusive design. I support products, projects, and cross-functional teams as a champion for best practices, web standards compliance, and accessibility. And most of all, I'm passionate about design systems, design tools and processes as the means to express inclusive design at scale.


As part of the TELUS design system team for TELUS Digital, I help support the organization build products quickly and easily by improving the design systemâ€™s tools and processes through collaboration and communication. More recently, I'm supporting the Digital Commerce team to deliver a unified customer experience. I continue to express my passion for design systems as the Content and Social Media Manager for the Design Systems Community, a group helping to bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling and maintaining design systems.
