### Hey, my name is Donna Vitan!

I'm a user experience, interaction, and visual designer committed to inclusive design. I support products, projects, and cross-functional teams as a champion for best practices, web standards compliance, and accessibility. And most of all, I'm passionate about design systems, design tools and processes as the means to express inclusive design at scale.
